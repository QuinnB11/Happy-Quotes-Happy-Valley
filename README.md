# Happy-Quotes-Happy-Valley

A flutter app that creates a new "Happy Message" every day that is specific to Penn State. This app pulls from a Firestore database that contains over 100 curated messages. It then gives the user the option to send notifications every day to look at the new daily quote. 

To run the app, 

1. download the ``GoogleService-Info.plist`` file
2. If on IOS, ``cd`` into ios folder and run ``pod update`` to update the pods for IOS
3. ``cd`` into the main directory and run:
```flutter run lib/main.dart```
